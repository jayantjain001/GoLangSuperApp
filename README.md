# GoLangSuperApp
GoLang app with REST APIs , Gorm DB queries and connection pool  , gRPC and all my Go learnings



*  Go conventions to remember : 

1.  type Album struct         // for structs start letter to be Capital same as in Java

2.  if fields/func/ variable 's first letter is capital then means public access of them for all

3.  unused imports/ variables will give compile errors


*  write the function in format as below

func ( pointerToReceiver *ReceiverType )  MethodName   ( input params ... )     ( returnType , error)
